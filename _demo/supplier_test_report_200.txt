 Supplier Test Report: Study N456 Compliance Review

#### Summary:
- **Impact Toughness:
The impact toughness of the component was measured using the Charpy impact tester. All test samples met the specified impact toughness limits.

Impact Toughness Results:

Sample A: Measured value: 22 Joules (Specified limit: 20-25 Joules)
Sample B: Measured value: 24 Joules (Specified limit: 22-27 Joules)
Sample C: Measured value: 19 Joules (Specified limit: 18-23 Joules)

Thermal Expansion Coefficient:
The thermal expansion coefficient was measured across different temperature ranges using a dilatometer. The results varied, with Sample B falling outside the specified limits at higher temperatures.

- **Thermal Expansion Coefficient Results:

Temperature Range 25-100°C:

Sample A: Measured value: 11.5 µm/m·K (Specified limit: 10-12 µm/m·K)
Sample B: Measured value: 11.8 µm/m·K (Specified limit: 10-12 µm/m·K)
Sample C: Measured value: 10.5 µm/m·K (Specified limit: 10-12 µm/m·K)
Temperature Range 100-200°C:

Sample A: Measured value: 13.2 µm/m·K (Specified limit: 12-14 µm/m·K)
Sample B: Measured value: 14.8 µm/m·K (Specified limit: 12-14 µm/m·K)
Sample C: Measured value: 13.5 µm/m·K (Specified limit: 12-14 µm/m·K)
Temperature Range 200-300°C:

Sample A: Measured value: 15.5 µm/m·K (Specified limit: 14-16 µm/m·K)
Sample B: Measured value: 16.5 µm/m·K (Specified limit: 14-16 µm/m·K)
Sample C: Measured value: 15.2 µm/m·K (Specified limit: 14-16 µm/m·K)

- **Additional Notes:
The supplier mentioned using a secondary method for the thermal expansion coefficient test due to primary equipment maintenance.
The primary method specified in the Qualification Test Plan (QTP) should be used unless the secondary method is validated and approved.
Recommendation: Re-test Sample B using the primary dilatometer once it is back in operation to confirm the thermal expansion coefficient at higher temperatures and ensure compliance.
