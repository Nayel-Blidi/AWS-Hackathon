### Individual Test Chapters

#### Impact Toughness Test
- **Objective:** Ensure the component meets impact toughness limits.
- **Test Conditions:** Room temperature.
- **Measurement Equipment:** Charpy Impact Tester.
- **Procedure:**
  1. Align the sample with the impact tester.
  2. Perform the impact test and record the absorbed energy.
  3. Compare the absorbed energy with specified limits.

#### Thermal Expansion Coefficient Test
- **Objective:** Ensure the component meets thermal expansion coefficient limits.
- **Test Conditions:** Room temperature.
- **Measurement Equipment:** Dilatometer.
- **Procedure:**
  1. Place the sample in the dilatometer.
  2. Measure the thermal expansion as temperature varies.
  3. Record the expansion coefficient.
  4. Compare the measured values with specified limits.
